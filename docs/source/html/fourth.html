   <p> Besides being a versatile ingredient to a number of recipes, oats have a host of health benefits that can't be ignored. Although oats are light on the stomach, they are packed with fibre and essential nutrients that keeps our system going. Since they are low on fat, oats may also help you shed some kilos.
